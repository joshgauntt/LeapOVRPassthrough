A small application which displays the IR video feed of a Leap Motion controller mounted to a VR headset when the user slides their hand over it.
This app was greatly inspired by Leap Motion's own [Quick Switch](https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/gallery/quick-switch), which unfortunately never made it out of Unity and which is now deprecated with the Orion 4.0.0 drivers.

## Installation

Simply download the latest release, extract it somewhere and then launch it, ideally after SteamVR is already running.
If it's not, SteamVR will start automatically.
To quit the application, simply right-click the tray icon and select "Exit".

## Usage

Mount your Leap Motion controller to your VR headset, and install the Orion 4.0 driver ([Tutorial](https://developer.leapmotion.com/vr-setup/general)).
After you have launched the app, it will sit quietly in the background, waiting for you to slide your hand over the controller from the top.
If you do so, an overlay will appear in front of you.
Sliding your hand over the controller again will hide the overlay.
