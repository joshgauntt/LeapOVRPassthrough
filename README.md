This is a forked and updated working repo from https://github.com/jangxx/LeapOVRPassthrough, this is updated to work on the latest Leap drivers and steamvr and is working with the bigscreen beyond!

## Installation

Simply download the latest release, extract it somewhere and then launch it, ideally after SteamVR is already running.
If it's not, SteamVR will start automatically.
To quit the application, simply right-click the tray icon and select "Exit".

## Usage

Mount your Leap Motion controller to your VR headset.
After you have launched the app, it will sit quietly in the background, waiting for you to slide your hand over the controller from the top.
If you do so, an overlay will appear in front of you.
Sliding your hand over the controller again will hide the overlay.
* One note, when trying to activate the passthrough with index controllers on, slide your forearm over the leap instead of your hand, as the forearm will be captured fully.
